They communicated regularly and understood our requirements exceptionally well. Even during the difficult lockdown period, we received excellent remote support to deploy the system. What amazed me was the work ethics of the team to deliver quality work with attention to details while remaining within a tight deadline. Choosing Qbex was a wise decision for us as digitalization has visibly improved our operational efficiency and effectiveness."

Multi processes can be carried out at the same time with ease and the security & back up of the information makes it more reliable. The thing that I like the most about Qbex is the speed and accuracy of report cards that it generates. We always receive excellent support from the Qbex team, especially during report card preparation and distribution. It saves our teachers a lot of time and effort."
